1. most of the patterns will have nested loops.
2. mostly 2 loops - outer loop and inner.
3. outer loop is for the rows
4. inner loop is for columns.
5. 4 rules:
6. for the outer loop, count the no.of rows
7. for the inner loop, focus on the columns, and CONNECT them somehow to the rows
8. whatever you are printing, print them inside the inner loop.
9. Observe symmetry (optional)
